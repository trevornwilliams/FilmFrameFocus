<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppetry">Puppetry</a> has been an important part of cinema since the silent days. There are several types of puppetry and a variety of controls in their operation. There are physical manipulations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_puppet">hand and rod puppetry</a>, but there are also more mechanical means such as cable control and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servomotor">servo motors</a>. These last two are what blur the line between puppets and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animatronics">animatronics</a>.</p>

<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCoqaaVD7-A" title="Puppet Show | Lili | Warner Archive" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/lili/">Lili</a></em> (1953), <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001989">Leslie Caron</a> plays a 16-year-old girl who gets entranced by a puppet show. When she should be working, she interacts with the puppets as if they are living, sentient beings. Even though Caron’s portrayal is to show her naivete, this captures an essential part of puppetry. Puppetry relies on the association of the real to make an audience believe in the movement of inanimate objects.</p>

<p>Since puppetry is a real time manipulation of objects, it can also loosely apply to the physical manipulation of people as seen in the Japanese film <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/double-suicide">Double Suicide</a></em> (1969).</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzULuVYa6t0?si=CsDu7lPUMY_V__CJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>Double Suicide</em> is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku">bunraku</a> play <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Suicides_at_Amijima">The Love Suicides at Amijima</a></em>. While <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793983">Masahiro Shinoda</a> used actors in his story, the film begins with setting up a bunraku style puppet show and includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuroko">kuroku</a> (stagehands dressed in all black) to manipulate the actors just as they would the puppets in a typical bunraku performance.</p>

<p>While most puppet related films had actors as the protagonists up to this point, once <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001345">Jim Henson</a> introduced his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets">Muppets</a> to the world puppets could take the spotlight. Henson was always at the technological forefront for what could be done in puppetry, but it wasn’t until <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-dark-crystal/">The Dark Crystal</a></em> (1982) that his innovation caught up enough to be able to make an all encompassing puppet-based world for film.</p>

<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CuqLsZ4qkNY" title="The Dark Crystal - Trailer" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Undoubtedly, Jim Henson is the most influential figure in modern puppetry. <em>The Dark Crystal</em> became a cult classic after an initially poor run at the box office and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Henson's_Creature_Shop's_Creature_Shop">Jim Henson’s Creature Shop</a> is still a pre-eminent force in the creation of puppets and animatronics.</p>

<p>Beyond the influence of Henson, puppetry is otherwise relatively uncommon in films in the past few decades. There are a few great films that feature puppeteers such as <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-double-life-of-veronique/">The Double Life of Veronique</a></em> (1991) or <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-puppetmaster/">The Puppetmaster</a></em> (1993), but the most influential would probably be <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/being-john-malkovich/">Being John Malkovich</a></em> (1999). While the puppetry is seemingly based in satire, it also accurately shows what it’s like to be a puppeteer.</p>

<p>As puppets and animatronics have mostly been replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery">CGI</a> in film in the past twenty years, there are still some interesting puppet-based works, primarily in short films. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378210">Heather Henson</a>’s <a href="https://www.handmadepuppetdreams.com/">Handmade Puppet Dreams</a> is a great resource for filmmakers embracing puppetry.</p>

<p>One feature film to come out of Handmade Puppet Dreams is <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/yamasong-march-of-the-hollows/">Yamasong: March of the Hollows</a></em> (2017). A visually stunning film that shows the possibilities of the medium on a limited budget.</p>

<p>&lt;br/&gt;</p>

<p>After finally getting around to watching <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459666/reference">The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant</a></em> (1972), I’m primarily fascinated by the first song used on the soundtrack –”<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Taiwan#New_Taiwanese_Cinema,_1982–1990">Smoke Gets in Your Eyes</a>”.</p>

<p>The song had been in three films before The Platters covered it in 1958: <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396284/">Roberta</a></em> (1933), <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0945981/">Till the Clouds Roll By</a></em> (1946), and <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091355/reference">Lovely to Look At</a></em> (1952). Originally a showtune from 1933, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/american-graffiti/">The Platters</a> reached number one on the Billboard charts in 1958 and their cover has been in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1323963/">24 movies since then</a>. The first movie to use it on the soundtrack was <em>The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant</em>.</p>

<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2WnTfjCEohs" title="The Platters - Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (from &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot;)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459666/reference">Rainer Werner Fassbinder</a> used it to set the relationship between titular Petra and her employee Marlene as he established the atmosphere of style and control.</p>

<p>Some filmmakers are famous for their use of pop music on their soundtrack; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Taiwan#New_Taiwanese_Cinema,_1982–1990">Kenneth Anger</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396284/">Martin Scorsese</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0945981/">Quentin Tarantino</a> are prime examples. While they often use music to contrast against a scene, a song like “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” immediately gives a level of romanticism to almost any scene it’s in.</p>

<p>The first American film to use the song was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091355/reference">George Lucas</a>’ memory fueled trip to the past, <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/american-graffiti/">American Graffiti</a></em> (1973).</p>

<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1q-QWHUU0g" title="American Graffiti (3/10) Movie CLIP - A Snowball Dance (1973) HD" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Lucas uses it to contrast the romance of a slow dance against a couple fighting, in this case <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459666/reference">Ron Howard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Taiwan#New_Taiwanese_Cinema,_1982–1990">Cindy Williams</a>. As they fear drifting apart, the song keeps them together.</p>

<p>Over a decade later, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396284/">Steven Spielberg</a> uses the same song to summarize the romance between Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss in <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0945981/">Always</a></em> (1989). Spielberg uses the song now as a more removed memory than Lucas did in <em>American Graffiti</em>, showing how time passed for these filmmakers of the same generation.</p>

<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2pxEIKeQs0" title="Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: Always &amp; Platters, Holly Hunter, Richard Dreyfuss" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Lucas and Spielberg weren’t the only friends to use the song decades apart. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Taiwan#New_Taiwanese_Cinema,_1982–1990">New Taiwanese Cinema</a> filmmakers <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396284/">Hou Hsiao-Hsien</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0945981/">Edward Yang</a> both used “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” years apart as each reflected on the memories, and ultimately romances, of their characters’ stories.</p>

<p>Just as Lucas used the song to contrast the fight in <em>American Graffiti</em>, Yang uses it in <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091355/reference">The Terrorizers</a></em> (1986) to give contrast to a sense of loneliness in the moment.</p>

<p>Hou’s <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459666/reference">Three Times</a></em> (2005) was probably the first time I really thought about the song. The opening scene uses the song to indicate that this will be a romance, establishing a tone place for the first act.</p>

<p>&lt;br/&gt;</p>

<p>A song can either reinforce preconceived ideas of a story or be used to enhance the action on-screen by contrasting it. “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” is a less recognized though often used way to enhance the scenes it plays behind.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1968, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0337348">William Greaves</a> set out to make a film about filmmaking. He called it “a fragment of the Godhead which is made up of other Godhead fragments.” This movie became <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296881">Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One</a></em> (1968).</p>

<p>Symbiopsychotaxiplasm is a deconstruction of the filmic form. The basic elements of the cinema are based around the non-existence of apparent camera and sound equipment. Based on the Hollywood-Mosfilm model by which most films are created, filmmaking techniques are supposed to be invisible.</p>

<p>Greaves created a screen test for his actors and assigned three cameras to film the event. The first camera focuses on the actors and the scene. The second camera focuses on the first camera crew filming the actors. The third camera focuses on the first camera, second camera, and the actors –basically everything encompassed in the filmmaking process.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Symbiopsychotaxiplasm/Symbiopsychotaxiplasm_TitleCard.jpg" alt="Symbiopsychotaxiplasm Title Card" /></p>

<p>The point of view that Greaves holds on filmmaking is the film will tell itself. A director is “a person who gets his ego out of his own way, he is at best a collaborator and servant of nature… but who, paradoxically, firmly controls the conditions of spontaneity, theatricality, and drama on the set.” His attempts at creating a short narrative-transitive based scene in a largely narrative-intransitive film are his means of exposing the constructs of the scene and film as a storytelling medium. A documentary is based on the assumption that the events, people, and places exist and are presented by a reliable source. Here, Greaves exploration of the documentary is comparable to jazz. The assumption is that it is based on improvisation and spontaneity in filmmaking and that it does not come out of rehearsal and interference. At any point, the film could have been based in the created reality of fiction or the experienced reality of documentary.</p>

<p>The Symbiopsychotaxiplasm moment explores the idea of one of these two realities on film. Our perception of a film is the impression of a reality we have upon viewing, whether fiction against documentary or narrative against avant-garde. It is similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparatus_theory">Basic Cinematographic Apparatus</a> (the impression of reality based on the recording of images and their reproduction to be projected) that Jean-Louis Baudry presented. Greaves attempts to present in Symbiopsychotaxiplasm the Basic Cinematographic Apparatus that “offers the subject perception ‘of a reality’ whose status seems similar to that of representations experienced as perception.”</p>

<p>Throughout the film, there are several moments at which the crew discusses the evolution of the filmmaking process. They film themselves without the director present, only to help document the process for the director later since he is also his own editor. These moments of reflection by the crew are all under the assumption that the director did not instigate their discussions or influence their moments of self-expression about the film.</p>

<p>When the film crew later confronts the director about the project and their own conflict and confusion, Greaves tells them, “It’s a circus with a better script.” He wants to improvise something that is better than the written screen test as a reflection of the ‘establishment’ and a representation of the counter-cultural sentiments in the US at the time. It is a “creative piece of cinematic experience” as Greaves divulges his own expectations to the crew following eight days of filming the same screen test repeatedly with occasionally different actors.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Symbiopsychotaxiplasm/Symbiopsychotaxiplasm_BillGreaves.jpeg" alt="Bill Greaves" /></p>

<p>This experiment in filmmaking took nearly 130,000 feet of 16mm film (or roughly 55 hours). A producer -impressed with Greave’s previous documentary work- funded the Symbiopsychotaxiplasm Operation. The producer told him to make whatever he wanted. With complete control over his project, Greaves could create a film without the limitations of having overbearing control of producers and investors. The film’s photography was finished in 1968, though it took three years to finish the editing before a print was struck in 1971. At that time, Greaves took it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> where it was screened. The projectionist confused the reels of the film and the screened film was nearly indecipherable for the audience, losing most of any chance for it finding an audience.</p>

<p>The confusion of reels on an experimental film such as Symbiopsychotaxiplasm would ruin the point of a documentary exploring the concept of filmmaking. After editing 55 hours of footage down to 75 minutes, the apparent narrative structure of the film would be loss as it is an experiment in storytelling. The intended presentation was made in editing. As in the film itself, Greaves explores the film developing as it is shot based on idea and not story. The structure of the filmic narrative came from the filming and editing of an idea, not from the story, script, and overall pre-production process.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Symbiopsychotaxiplasm/Symbiopsychotaxiplasm_Crew.jpeg" alt="Crew" /></p>

<p>Symbiopsychotaxiplasm is a learning experience. It is not only an attempt to capture a moment, whether reality or simulacrum of reality, that is essential in understanding film as a form. A film does not have to be entertaining by conventional means if it is interesting. A film can be intellectually stimulating as it attacks the viewer’s perception of film and still be a worthy experience for the film viewer.</p>

<p>Symbiopsychotaxiplasm can also be used to examine a breakdown of storytelling. The crew in one scene examines the possibility that at any point the director might be hiding on the other side of a wall directing them and their discussion of the process of making a film. They are discussing whether or not Greaves is controlling the theatricality of capturing reality and what is presented, as reality could very well be fiction.</p>

<p>A story is presented based on the assumption that it is either a documentary or fiction. The film is the reflection of the intended vision by the filmmaker. It could be the focus of the camera or the order in which it is edited that determines a vision if it is not already present in the screenplay or design. By blurring the line between reality and fiction, Greaves expressed an element of himself and the experimentation that he sought in creating this film. It is a reflection of an author with the contribution of the cast and crew. The director becomes the so-called ‘Godhead’ that Greaves believed his film represented as the crew became the ‘fragments of the Godhead.’</p>

<p>In the same year that William Greaves was making Symbiopsychotaxiplasm, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000419">Jean-Luc Godard</a> was working on his film One AM (1968) which pursued similar themes. Though Godard abandoned the film in postproduction, it paralleled Symbiopsychotaxiplasm as an approach to the filmic experience that Godard shot in Chicago. Both films were attempts at counter-cinema and Symbiopsychotaxiplasm can be compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wollen">Peter Wollen</a>’s breakdown of the revolutionary countering elements that Godard used in his cinema of the late 1960s. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Narrative Transitivity / Narrative Intransitivity: The narrative is not transitive as it is built upon episodes of a screen test filmed repeatedly, sometimes with different actors and intermittent moments of digression as Greaves plays the role of director and stops them in the acting exercise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identification / Estrangement: The characters are estranged from the audience, as they are breakdowns of characters themselves. The crewmembers are the only people to which identification can be found as they struggle to understand what is actually going on in the film alongside the audience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transparency / Foregrounding: The mechanics of filmmaking are visible throughout the film, foregrounding the fact that this is a movie and a not a suspension of disbelief.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Single Diegesis / Multiple Diegesis: The film presents multiple diegesis, as there are separate worlds for the film within the film and an overarching documentation of the separate worlds presented.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Closure / Aperture: The film is based on the idea that the audience understands the role of film and the crew apparent in the filmmaking process. This creates a world based on the intertextuality of not only referencing the filmmaking world, but also the process of interaction in presenting a reality of any sort.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pleasure / Unpleasure: The experience of the viewer in watching this film is not to be entertained, but to challenge the viewer in his/her perception of film and what is the actual reality presented.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fiction / Reality: The film is itself a questioning of fiction pitted against reality. At which point does the capturing of a reality become a representation of that reality or does it always become a representation of the filmmaker.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Symbiopsychotaxiplasm created its own counter-cinema model parallel to Godard. Godard would be the more cited individual in film history as he was already famous by the time he decided to pursue counter-cinema, breaking with the traditional filmmaking model of logical narrative progression. It was Greaves’ struggle and passion for filmmaking that led him to create a film such as Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One.</p>

<p>With all their similarities, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre">theatre</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film">film</a> are still different experiences. Theatre can be narrative based through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy">dramaturgy</a> or an experience such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectacle">spectacle</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procession">pageantry</a>. Film can create endless worlds on screen, sometime narrative and sometimes avant-garde, that can allow for greater levels of detain in its quest for world building.</p>

<p>While prominent theatrical performances are often filmed and broadcast in cinemas, the planning is often less than cinematic. Performance is key to the theatrical experience, but the proper choice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_stock">film stock</a> in addition to the framing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_\(visual_arts\)">composition</a> allows for a more cinematic experience. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>’s filmed version of <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475331/">The Magic Flute</a></em> (1975) was important for this in trying to film the experience of a theatrical performance rather than the performance itself.</p>

<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yS9-9ic9A4" title="Ingmar Bergman&#39;s The Magic Flute - new trailer | BFI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The primary difference between film and theatre is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up">close-up</a>. The creative choice that makes <em>The Magic Flute</em> watchable, aside from the brisk editing, is Bergman’s choice to start behind the stage as he routinely goes in and out breaking that barrier, but also creating a deeper immersion for the performance on stage and capturing the audiences reaction through close-ups.</p>

<p>The audience is one of the most important parts of theatre. While film often strives for realism, there’s an inherent suspension of disbelief that allows for more experimentation when the audience is present. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Kantor">Tadeusz Kantor</a>’s <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176266/">The Dead Class</a></em> (1977) is a classic of Polish avant-garde theatre captured on film by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Wajda">Andrzej Wajda</a>.</p>

<iframe width="660" height="495" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aABFgNJOTZ4" title="Kantor La classe morta parte 1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>The Dead Class</em> is, more or less, a work of memory and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism">nihilism</a>. Beyond that, it can be left to interpretation. What Wajda does in his film is cinematically capture what it can feel like for an intimate performance. This is not a stage, but there is an audience. The audience is less important compared to Kantor himself directing and orchestrating his play as Wajda directs and orchestrates the camera around it. As a different art-form than Bergman’s opera on film, Wajda’s experimental theatre replicates the intimacy of the avant-garde on stage.</p>

<p>Whereas <em>The Magic Flute</em> was staged specifically for an audience to be filmed and <em>The Dead Class</em> captured a performance as it would be seen in Poland at the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Malle">Louis Malle</a> stripped down the theatrical qualities to a minimum in <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111590/">Vanya 42nd Street</a></em> (1994).</p>

<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4WceRNb7e0" title="Three Reasons: Vanya on 42nd Street" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>Vanya on 42nd Street</em> is an adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov">Chekhov</a>’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Vanya">Uncle Vanya</a></em>, adapted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet">David Mamet</a>, staged by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Gregory">Andre Gregory</a>, and directed by Louis Malle. In setting the film up as a workshop rehearsal in an abandoned theater, the attention is brought to the fact that there aren’t any costumes, sets, or audience. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenic_design">stage design</a> is removed except for the few props they handle as part of the story.</p>

<p>Without the audience, we see the creative process of staging <em>Uncle Vanya</em>. Once we get used to the lack of stage design, we fall in love with the characters through the writing and camerawork specifically designed to let the performances shine. By placing <em>Vanya on 42nd Street</em> inside a theatre, no matter how dilapidated, we become the necessary audience for <em>Uncle Vanya</em>.</p>

<p>The commonality in translating the theatrical experience for all three of these films is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht">Brecht</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distancing_effect">Verfremdungseffekt, or distancing effect</a>. For film to capture what it means to see live theatre, the artificiality of accepting a performance is on full display as these films break the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall">fourth wall</a> and allow us to experience the performance above all else. To replicate the theatrical experience, there needs to be more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding">world building</a> by exposing the processes in staging rather than simply filming a performance.</p>

<iframe width="660" height="495" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdLuNtbSAck" title="Hollywood Stars In Communist Activities (1947)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Film is an essential art in the communication of ideas to the masses. It allows for the acceptance and normalization of morals and the evolution of society. Any attempt at suppressing freedom of speech, whether through laws or by instilling fear, inhibits the arts and their impact on the world. As politics in the US experience a deepening rift between the American two party system, the freedom of expression is threatened out of fear of politicization of the most basic concepts. This is the greatest threat to the arts since the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) imprisoned ten men from Hollywood for the terrifyingly simple idea of being uncooperative in 1947.</p>

<p>Hollywood’s pro-military stance during World War II had been re-interpreted as sympathetic to communism in the shift to peace time. With a change in the majority , films made with government support under a Democrat-led Congress were now seen as subversive under the new Republican-led Congress. With this shift in power from within the government, Hollywood was deemed a threat to the United States under the guidance of HUAC Chairman J. Parnell Thomas.</p>

<p>During the war, the Roosevelt administration had control over the Office of War Information (OWI). The OWI was responsible for controlling propaganda, making suggestions and attempting to influence the films released by Hollywood. They approved films such as <em>Action in the North Atlantic</em> (1943) and <em>Mission to Moscow</em> (1943) in an attempt to help with public perception of an ally, but it was for this very reason that the HUAC attacked it following the war. The growing fear of communism allowed Chairman Thomas to claim “hundreds of very prominent film capital people” were card-carrying communists and placed them on his long lists of names involved with the Communist Party. Though some people would become known as “friendly” witnesses for their cooperation, there were ultimately nineteen witnesses declared “unfriendly” by the committee.</p>

<p>Before going to Washington, the nineteen witnesses gathered at the house of Herbert Biberman to prepare for the testimony. All nineteen were at some point members of the Communist Party, but also ten of them were Jews. This does not seem to be a coincidence as the committee called upon cast and crew from two films released in 1947 that dealt with anti-Semitism: <em>Crossfire</em> (1947) and <em>Gentleman’s Agreement</em> (1947). The discussion at Biberman’s meeting was largely revolved around what the group of witnesses would say in front of the Committee, though no deep fear had been instilled in the nineteen yet.</p>

<p>In October of 1947, the hearings of the Hollywood witnesses began. People from all over Hollywood were being summoned to testify, conservative and liberal. The first witness called upon by the committee was then head of Warner Bros. Jack Warner. Alongside other “friendly” witnesses such as Louis B. Mayer, Warner consider himself and other cooperating witnesses to be blameless. Still, the committee cited them with producing anti-American referencing films such as <em>Mission to Moscow</em>. Warner would later claim in his ghost memoirs that Roosevelt personally asked him to produce <em>Mission to Moscow</em>, though he attributed it to Ambassador Joseph Davies during the hearings. Either way, calling these films anti-American was a largely political move as the Republican headed committee sought any defamation they could find against the Roosevelt administration.</p>

<p>After the attacks on the “friendly” witnesses, there came the time for the so-called “unfriendly” witnesses. Eleven of the nineteen “unfriendly” witnesses testified in front of the committee. They were mostly writers with all but one being Jewish. They were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alvah Bessie</li>
  <li>Herbert Biberman</li>
  <li>Bertolt Brecht</li>
  <li>Lester Cole</li>
  <li>Edward Dmytrik</li>
  <li>Ring Lardner Jr.</li>
  <li>John Howard Lawson</li>
  <li>Albert Maltz</li>
  <li>Samuel Ornitz</li>
  <li>Adrian Scott</li>
  <li>Dalton Trumbo</li>
</ul>

<p>The eleven “unfriendly” witnesses had all at one point or another been communists. Even if they were not still members, their left-leaning politics often showed up in their films. The idea of eliminating “intolerance and stereotypes” was an idea viewed by Chairman Thomas as communist and found to be a consistent theme from within all of their films.</p>

<p>Adrian Scott and Edward Dmytrik were brought in front of the committee because of their film <em>Crossfire</em> (1947), which itself fought intolerance. The idea was that only a communist would make the murderer of a Jew to be a recently discharged soldier. <em>Crossfire</em> was the first film to directly deal with anti-Semitism in the postwar years, coming at an appropriate time after the discovery of the atrocities of the Holocaust.</p>

<p><em>Crossfire</em> was praised commercially and critically before being nominated for five Academy Awards. Because it dealt with the trouble of reintegration into society by soldiers and prejudice built out of ignorance, the story was deemed subversive. Dmytrik explored the building tension inside and outside of the soldier accused in the film, most notably in the coffee scene. The soldier does not notice that the coffee is boiling over, using his distraction to comment on what happens in everyday life, but also it is at this time that he has a realization of the building situation around him. Showing an accused soldier’s weakness in contrast to a strong soldier as the actual murderer gave J. Parnell Thomas enough evidence to summon Dmytrik and Scott.</p>

<p>With <em>Action in the North Atlantic</em>, John Howard Lawson was able to express his support for the Communist Party indirectly. When an international convoy is set up to take supplies to Russia, we see equality among all of the nations involved. The ships sail as equals, representing the support of all of our allies in the war. One of Lawson’s main influences for the screenplay was <em>Battleship Potemkin</em> (1925). He constructed it to be shot in a series of montages to keep the pace going and create a unified picture by clashing images together.</p>

<p><em>Action in the North Atlantic</em> was made for the Roosevelt administration at Warner Bros. under what was then nicknamed the Roosevelt Studio. Jack Warner was a devout follower of FDR. By attacking Action In The North Atlantic, Parnell had attacked Jack Warner and indirectly Roosevelt and the Democrat government during the war years.</p>

<p>Ten of the “unfriendly” witnesses cited the First Amendment as opposed to the Fifth Amendment and refused to cooperate. Only one agreed to cooperate with the committee. The other ten were then cited for contempt of Congress and quickly became known as “The Hollywood Ten.”</p>

<p>The attacks on the Hollywood Ten benefited Republicans as it spread the fear of communism while justifying their revenge on the former Democrat government. The final witness was separated from the rest by his lack of credits and foreign citizenship.</p>

<p>Bertolt Brecht only had one Hollywood screen credit to his name when brought before the committee. The film was <em>Hangmen Also Die!</em> (1943). Directed by Fritz Lang, <em>Hangmen Also Die!</em> was consistent to Brecht’s theatre work. The revolutionary attack of the workers coming together against fascism could easily reflect Brecht’s politics. The scenes of meetings of subversive members of the Czech resistance are separated from American ideology by endorsing the work of the group rather than the individual. The closest it comes to portraying individualism is the scene where Brian Donlevy tries to turn himself in for the greater good of the group. His fellow resistance fighter in fear that nobody else could do his job soon stops him. This was a film for every person to declare that the imposing government was bad.</p>

<p>Brecht understood what he was doing in front of the committee and the message he sought with his past work. <em>Hangmen Also Die!</em> could not easily be brought against him because he only received a credit for story. He then cooperated fully in fear of being imprisoned under one of the Alien Registration Acts. Following his testimony to the committee, Brecht left the United States, being the last witness brought before the committee until 1951.</p>

<p>Following the DC hearings in October of 1947, the Hollywood studio system responded with the Waldorf Statement on November 25, 1947. The statement announced the studios would “forthwith discharge without compensation” and “not re-employ any of the Ten” until they had declared under oath they were no longer Communists. This began the Hollywood Blacklist.</p>

<p>With the Hollywood Ten, J. Parnell Thomas had destroyed the careers of a group of influential filmmakers. Some would come back to the industry following their prison sentences, such as Edward Dmytrik, and others, like Samuel Ornitz, would never work in the film industry again. Thomas sought to correct what he saw as a destruction of capitalism under Roosevelt and that he was “the great Voice of democracy” to fix the US. Instead, he exposed the vulnerability of democracy and the damage a demagogue can create in instilling the population with fear of something they deem different.</p>

<p>While many filmmakers will commonly praise practical and optical effects, most modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects">visual effects</a> are created digitally. Digital is more efficient for time and money, allows for greater possibilities, and often creates impeccable images. The current craftsmanship of analog is often limited to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-camera_effect">in-camera effects</a>, but many couldn’t have been accomplished in the past without the use of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_printer">optical printer</a>.</p>

<p>Once an essential tool during post-production, the near forgotten <a href="https://cinefex.com/blog/optical-printer/">optical printer</a> is a device that can manipulate film footage by re-photographing each projected frame individually. This allowed for slight manipulations in the image to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_transition">transitions</a> and optical effects.</p>

<p>These effects created by the optical printer included:</p>

<p>When an optical printer is referenced, it is usually known as the device that effects pioneers such as Douglas Trumbull used on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/2001-a-space-odyssey/"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></a> (1968) or <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/blade-runner/"><em>Blade Runner</em></a> (1982). These visual effects were meant to be as invisible as possible so not to take you out of the story.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e13b779a521ce05b02b31c9/1581445941059-125CIQZ7AJSR9O924LPS/Walkabout.jpg" alt="Walkabout.jpg" /></p>

<p>Other filmmakers used optical printers to add to the narrative. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_effect"><em>Walkabout</em></a> (1971), Nicolas Roeg utilized transitions and optical effects compounded with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry">lens flares</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_angle">camera angles</a> to give a sense of being in the Australian outback, giving weight to the narrative through visual storytelling while drawing attention to the techniques.</p>

<p>While there are still some uses for optical printers with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry">photochemical</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_preservation">film restorations</a>, the primary user base for the past few decades is comprised of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_film">experimental filmmakers</a>.</p>

<p>Experimental filmmakers often work alone and must be competent as cinematographer, film lab, and editor to use an optical printer. One of the most famous experimental filmmakers was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_McLaren">Norm McLaren</a>. He won an Oscar for his short <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/neighbours/"><em>Neighbours</em></a> (1952), but his greatest work is arguably <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/pas-de-deux/"><em>Pas de deux</em></a> (1968).</p>

<p>&lt;br/&gt;</p>

<p>The effects in <em>Pas de Deux</em> can easily be recreated in almost any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_editing_system">Non-Linear Editor</a> now. Digital effects allow for a quicker creation, but it doesn’t account for creative output. Working in a dark room with an optical printer, McLaren worked frame by frame, having to wait until the footage was processed at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_laboratory">lab</a> to confirm that it turned out as he expected.</p>

<p>While Hollywood largely transitioned away from Optical Printing by the end of the 1980’s, experimental filmmakers continued to use these devices for their idiosyncratic works.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e13b779a521ce05b02b31c9/1581449045892-GOAENHSNYY5W5V8TK0M7/TheHeartOfTheWorld.jpg" alt="TheHeartOfTheWorld.jpg" /></p>

<p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-heart-of-the-world/">The Heart of the World</a> (2000) is often taught in film schools as an introduction to experimental film. Guy Maddin claimed the film couldn’t have turned out as expected <a href="https://guy-maddin.com/projects/the-heart-of-the-world/">without an optical printer</a>. Since then, Maddin has switched to mostly digital filmmaking, but the happy accidents that occurred in his earlier work can still be felt with every viewing, same as any other analog filmmaking.</p>

<p>There are so many more filmmakers that have utilized optical printing than what I’ve mentioned. Other notable filmmakers include to mention are <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104132/">Stan Brakhage</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0577263/">Jonas Mekas</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643171/">Nobuhiko Obayashi</a> (early work), <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0642271/">Pat O’Neill</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833247/">Chick Strand</a>, though the list goes on and on with many fascinating works.</p>

<p>In the midst of a crisis, the chance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality">herd mentality</a> greatly increases. With <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/11/21175987/trump-travel-ban-europe-coronavirus-speech">certain media groups and politicians fueling distrust</a>, <a href="https://laist.com/2020/03/10/coronavirus-fears-chinese-immigrants-guns.php">people are reacting by stocking up on guns and supplies</a> in fear of impending disaster. What better way to explore the dangers of panic than through cinema.</p>

<p>One prime example of herd mentality in film is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0245213/">Claude Duvivier</a>’s <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/panic/">Panique</a></em> (1947). An examination of how the French could have supported their Nazi occupiers, <em>Panique</em> gave a realistic look at how people will make decisions in a group that they wouldn’t consider on their own. A man is accused of murder simply because he is a bit different than everyone else in town and a small group of vocal critics entice the crowd to turn on him.</p>

<p>While I’m more partial to the remake <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/monsieur-hire/">Monsieur Hire</a></em> (1989), <em>Panique</em> is a better example of the dangers of crowds making decisions in relation to a contemporary setting.</p>

<p>Living in the Los Angeles area during this outbreak has given a greater sense of panic than other areas. People have sought out essential sanitary products to hoard and hide away. LA, and Hollywood in particular, have had a reputation for being behind the moral decay of this country. As ridiculous as it is, <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-day-of-the-locust/">The Day of the Locust</a></em> (1975) uses this idea to nth degree culminating in another herd mentality finale. At a movie premiere, a broken man is hit by a rock and beats the child that threw it. A riot breaks out as they attack the man all while the radio personality mistakes the riot for excitement for the movie premiere.</p>

<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQO5Xy2ebhs" title="The Burning of Los Angeles - The Day of the Locust (9/9) Movie CLIP (1975) HD" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Even when the film doesn’t add up, the riot in <em>The Day of the Locust</em> summarizes every anxiety presented in the story to that point. People relate to fear and will make the worst of a situation if they think something bad will happen to them. While other movies border on horror in presenting this sense of anxiety, a genre exercise in horror will show the worst in people. In <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/ringu-0/">Ringu 0</a></em> (2000), the third in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_\(franchise\)\(franchise\)">Japanese series</a>, Sadako’s curse is explored in the fear she instilled in her theater troupe. As she is accused of hurting others, the crowd feeds on each others fears to build to anger.</p>

<p>Fiction can be more truthful than reality, only because it’s a distilled and focused version of reality. The level of panic with the latest coronavirus hasn’t gotten too out of control, and hopefully it doesn’t reach the irrational levels in the above movies.</p>

<p>&lt;br/&gt;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://gizmodo.com/neural-networks-upscale-film-from-1896-to-4k-make-it-l-1841449875">video was posted to YouTube</a> today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8J_xbbBuGobmw_N5ga3MA">Denis Shiryaev</a> showing how he used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">Neural Network AI</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_scaler">upscale</a> historic footage, in this case <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-arrival-of-a-train-at-la-ciotat/">L’arrivée d’un train en gare de La Ciotat</a></em> (1896). There are many applications for this technology, most recently being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake">Deepfakes</a>, but the idea of upscaling brings great hope and suspicion to what could easily be done to save historic films.</p>

<p>Personally, I love the idea of being able to upscale to correct quality, but changing the framerate is still on par with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation">Motion Smoothing</a> and goes against the intention of most filmmakers. It reminds me of the controversy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Entertainment">Turner Entertainment</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_colorization">colorizing films</a> in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Would the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re">Lumières</a> roll over in their graves over the manipulation of their film? Probably not, but that doesn’t mean that we should do anything more to classic cinema than restore with the technology. The documentary <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/lumiere-2016/">Lumière!</a> (2016) was a much more respectful presentation of their work with beautiful restorations. As for the creative possibilites, this experiment just reinforces that anything is possible in cinema.</p>

<p>](https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/)</p>

<p>With the US success of <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/">기생충</a></em> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/">[](https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/)<em>[Parasite](https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/)</em>[]</a>, Neon has released Bong Joon-ho’s <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bong-joon-ho-black-white-parasite-cut-1274862">Black and White version</a> in LA and NYC. This isn’t the first time a filmmaker has revisited a film in black and white. <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/mad-max-fury-road/">Mad Max: Fury Road</a></em> (2015) and <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-mist/">The Mist</a></em> (2007) both had black and white versions released that were each considered the director’s preferred cut. <em>Parasite</em> in particular gives a greater level of contrast to the already layered story in the switch to black and white.</p>

<p>We see the world in color, but films must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading">color graded</a> for us to accept them. Shot by shot, the color correctionist must confirm the look intended by the director and cinematographer. When accomplished photochemically, the process determines the length of exposure for each shot via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_point">printer points</a>. The same process is mimicked digitally using a system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve">DaVinci Resolve</a>. When creating a black and white version of a film, the process is still corrected shot by shot so that every frame is exposed as intended since desaturating a shot can alter the perceived contrast.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393240/">Kyung-pyo Hong</a>’s cinematography and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4342766/">Ha-jun Lee</a>’s production design complement one another perfectly in <em>Parasite</em> in color, but by making it monochromatic, it brings greater attention to the <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/parasite-cinematographer-hong-kyung-pyo-1202189824/#!">visual cues</a> that separate them. Everything that needs to be seen is within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_latitude">latitude</a>, as the shadows show as much as the light. The families are contrasted that much more with the tonal variations in their setting and the light itself as the poorer family is always slightly darker than the richer family.</p>

<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001752/">Steven Soderbergh</a> desatured <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/raiders-of-the-lost-ark/">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a> on his site <a href="http://extension765.com/soderblogh/18-raiders">Extension 765</a> to study the staging. For me, the black and white brought greater attention to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005878/">Douglas Slocombe</a>’s cinematography and perfect exposure. (The perfect exposure is even more impressive if <a href="https://variety.com/2016/film/people-news/douglas-slocombe-dead-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-cinematographer-1201711843/#!">the stories of Slocombe</a> never using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_meter">light meter</a> are true.) The same works for <em>Parasite</em>, giving it a new dimension to admire its craft in what I believe was by far the greatest film of 2019.</p>

<p>](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-mother-and-the-whore/)</p>

<p>Last night, I watched <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-mother-and-the-whore/"><em>The Mother and the Whore</em></a> (1973) for the first time. It’s a film made by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinephilia">cineaste</a> about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinephilia">cinephile</a>, and since it’s been difficult to find in the US, it’s mainly cinephiles that seek it out. Certain movies are difficult to find for one reason or another and there isn’t too much information on how to easily track them down.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FilmStruck">FilmStruck</a> shut down, it showed that the availability of titles could easily narrow instead of expand. There hadn’t been such disappointing news for the cinephile community since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Yorker_Films">New Yorker Films</a> shuttered in 2009. (<em>The Mother and the Whore</em> is one of those films that became harder to find after New Yorker Films shut down, though it’s currently available on <a href="https://youtu.be/gFHn4xPeW14">YouTube</a> to stream for free.) Thankfully there are many wonderful services –such as <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com">Criterion Channel</a> and <a href="https://mubi.com">Mubi</a>– that have replaced FilmStruck in the past year. The problem with having so many streaming services available is picking which ones have the right movies for you and easily searching within them.</p>

<p>The first place I check when I want to watch something is <a href="https://letterboxd.com">Letterboxd</a>. While I initially used it as a film diary, it has become even more useful since they integrated <a href="https://www.justwatch.com">JustWatch</a> into their platform. (If you don’t want to upgrade your Letterboxd account to Pro, JustWatch itself is a great resource to find which services have a specific movie to stream.) Whether or not the title is available, of course, depends on the services listed on JustWatch. There are some mistakes on the availability of certain titles (ex. Rohmer’s <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/rendezvous-in-paris-1995/">Rendezvous in Paris</a></em> (1995) is on Amazon Prime, but oddly missing from a search on JustWatch), though overall it is a great place to start.</p>

<p>The rarer the film, the more research it will take to find a watchable version. If you’re looking for something that was only screened in a gallery setting, you often have to find go to that specific gallery to see it. While you can often find hard to find works on YouTube or <a href="http://www.ubu.com">UbuWeb</a>, many are still unavailable digitally. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kubelka">Peter Kubelka</a> hasn’t allowed his work to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine">telecined</a>, insisting it be projected as he originally intended. This is the same with many other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_film">underground filmmakers</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jacobs">Ken Jacobs</a>’ <a href="https://www.kenjacobsgallery.com">3D experiments</a> wouldn’t work as well on a small screen as at a cinema, though I did watch <em><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/jonas-mekas-in-kodachrome-days/">Jonas Mekas in Kodachrome Days</a></em> recently on Criterion Channel.</p>

<p>Streaming services aren’t the only resource to find a film. While not every city still has a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/jonas-mekas-in-kodachrome-days/">video rental store</a>, they are often a great resource for the movies that still aren’t available digitally. The few that are left are more like to carry harder to find titles than <a href="https://www.redbox.com">Redbox</a>, but overall physical media is also often cheaper to rent than a digital platform. (<a href="https://www.cinefilevideo.com">Cinefile Video</a> is the most well known in Los Angeles, and <a href="https://www.cinefilevideo.com">Vidiots</a> reopens this year, though I usually frequent <a href="http://vidtheque.com">Vidéothèque</a> in South Pasadena due to a well curated library and proximity.) Investing in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M8HMK79/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">region-free Blu-ray player</a> also opens a world of possibilities for the titles available to see. Being able to order a Blu-Ray from a distributor in the UK or South Korea allows you to track down certain titles, though they’re often expensive. One of the best cheap resources for physical media is used media stores, such as <a href="https://www.amoeba.com">Amoeba Music</a> in LA or chains such as <a href="https://hpb.com/">Half Price Books</a> or <a href="https://www.theexchange.com">The Exchange</a>. While it’s more about patience to seek out these titles, scouring store shelves allowed me to see hard to find titles like <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/daimajin/"><em>Daimajin</em></a> (1966) or <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-beat-that-my-heart-skipped/"><em>The Beat That My Heart Skipped</em></a> (2005).</p>

<p>There’s always a niche market for film fans, from Indies to International to Experimental and from Horror to Westerns to Fantasy. Once you know what you like, there’s an endless list of titles left to see.</p>
