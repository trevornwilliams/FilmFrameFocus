# Final Project

##Summary

My current personal site is here:  [FilmFrameFocus](https://filmframefocus.com). I haven't updated it since January, so the plan is to scrap it after this semester and build one from scratch elsewhere. This time I'll use code instead of Squarespace.

The main bug I need to fix is the MP4 on the Film page. For preview, it shows controls but not video so I'll have to check what I'm missing.  It needed an extension to preview in VS Code, but I thought that was still better for this exercise than linking to Vimeo or YouTube.

As it currently stands, I wouldn't make this public (especially using some of the displayed work), so I'm hoping in the near future I have a bit more finesse in creating a site using code.
