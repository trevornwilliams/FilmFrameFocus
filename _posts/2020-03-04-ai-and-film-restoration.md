# AI & Film Restoration

&lt;br/&gt;

A [video was posted to YouTube](https://gizmodo.com/neural-networks-upscale-film-from-1896-to-4k-make-it-l-1841449875) today by [Denis Shiryaev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8J_xbbBuGobmw_N5ga3MA) showing how he used [Neural Network AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to [upscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_scaler) historic footage, in this case _[L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-arrival-of-a-train-at-la-ciotat/)_ (1896). There are many applications for this technology, most recently being [Deepfakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake), but the idea of upscaling brings great hope and suspicion to what could easily be done to save historic films.

Personally, I love the idea of being able to upscale to correct quality, but changing the framerate is still on par with [Motion Smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation) and goes against the intention of most filmmakers. It reminds me of the controversy of [Turner Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Entertainment) [colorizing films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_colorization) in the 1980s.

Would the [Lumières](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re) roll over in their graves over the manipulation of their film? Probably not, but that doesn't mean that we should do anything more to classic cinema than restore with the technology. The documentary [Lumière!](https://letterboxd.com/film/lumiere-2016/) (2016) was a much more respectful presentation of their work with beautiful restorations. As for the creative possibilites, this experiment just reinforces that anything is possible in cinema.
