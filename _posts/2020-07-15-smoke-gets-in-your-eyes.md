# Smoke Gets in Your Eyes

<br/\>

After finally getting around to watching *[The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459666/reference)* (1972), I'm primarily fascinated by the first song used on the soundtrack –"[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Taiwan#New_Taiwanese_Cinema,_1982–1990)".

The song had been in three films before The Platters covered it in 1958: *[Roberta](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396284/)* (1933), *[Till the Clouds Roll By](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0945981/)* (1946), and *[Lovely to Look At](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091355/reference)* (1952). Originally a showtune from 1933, [The Platters](https://letterboxd.com/film/american-graffiti/) reached number one on the Billboard charts in 1958 and their cover has been in [24 movies since then](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1323963/). The first movie to use it on the soundtrack was *The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant*.

[Rainer Werner Fassbinder](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459666/reference) used it to set the relationship between titular Petra and her employee Marlene as he established the atmosphere of style and control.

Some filmmakers are famous for their use of pop music on their soundtrack; [Kenneth Anger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Taiwan#New_Taiwanese_Cinema,_1982–1990), [Martin Scorsese](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396284/), and [Quentin Tarantino](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0945981/) are prime examples. While they often use music to contrast against a scene, a song like "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" immediately gives a level of romanticism to almost any scene it's in.

The first American film to use the song was [George Lucas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091355/reference)' memory fueled trip to the past, *[American Graffiti](https://letterboxd.com/film/american-graffiti/)* (1973).

<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1q-QWHUU0g" title="American Graffiti (3/10) Movie CLIP - A Snowball Dance (1973) HD" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Lucas uses it to contrast the romance of a slow dance against a couple fighting, in this case [Ron Howard](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459666/reference) and [Cindy Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Taiwan#New_Taiwanese_Cinema,_1982–1990). As they fear drifting apart, the song keeps them together.

Over a decade later, [Steven Spielberg](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396284/) uses the same song to summarize the romance between Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss in *[Always](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0945981/)* (1989). Spielberg uses the song now as a more removed memory than Lucas did in *American Graffiti*, showing how time passed for these filmmakers of the same generation.

Lucas and Spielberg weren't the only friends to use the song decades apart. [New Taiwanese Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Taiwan#New_Taiwanese_Cinema,_1982–1990) filmmakers [Hou Hsiao-Hsien](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396284/) and [Edward Yang](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0945981/) both used "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" years apart as each reflected on the memories, and ultimately romances, of their characters' stories.

Just as Lucas used the song to contrast the fight in *American Graffiti*, Yang uses it in *[The Terrorizers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091355/reference)* (1986) to give contrast to a sense of loneliness in the moment.

Hou's *[Three Times](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459666/reference)* (2005) was probably the first time I really thought about the song. The opening scene uses the song to indicate that this will be a romance, establishing a tone place for the first act.

A song can either reinforce preconceived ideas of a story or be used to enhance the action on-screen by contrasting it. "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" is a less recognized though often used way to enhance the scenes it plays behind.
