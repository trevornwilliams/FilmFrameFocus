# Optical Printing

While many filmmakers will commonly praise practical and optical effects, most modern [visual effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects) are created digitally. Digital is more efficient for time and money, allows for greater possibilities, and often creates impeccable images. The current craftsmanship of analog is often limited to [in-camera effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-camera_effect), but many couldn't have been accomplished in the past without the use of an [optical printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_printer).

Once an essential tool during post-production, the near forgotten [optical printer](https://cinefex.com/blog/optical-printer/) is a device that can manipulate film footage by re-photographing each projected frame individually. This allowed for slight manipulations in the image to create [transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_transition) and optical effects.

These effects created by the optical printer included:

- [Time Manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate)
- [Fade/Dissolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolve_\(filmmaking\))
- [Wipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipe_\(transition\))
    - Push-Off
    - Vertical Movement
- [Superimposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superimposition)
- [Split-Screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_screen_\(video_production\))
- [Mattes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matte_\(filmmaking\))
- [Optical Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_\(filmmaking\))

When an optical printer is referenced, it is usually known as the device that effects pioneers such as Douglas Trumbull used on [_2001: A Space Odyssey_](https://letterboxd.com/film/2001-a-space-odyssey/) (1968) or [_Blade Runner_](https://letterboxd.com/film/blade-runner/) (1982). These visual effects were meant to be as invisible as possible so not to take you out of the story.

![Walkabout.jpg](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e13b779a521ce05b02b31c9/1581445941059-125CIQZ7AJSR9O924LPS/Walkabout.jpg)

Other filmmakers used optical printers to add to the narrative. For [_Walkabout_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_effect) (1971), Nicolas Roeg utilized transitions and optical effects compounded with [lens flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry) and [camera angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_angle) to give a sense of being in the Australian outback, giving weight to the narrative through visual storytelling while drawing attention to the techniques.

While there are still some uses for optical printers with [photochemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry)[film restorations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_preservation), the primary user base for the past few decades is comprised of [experimental filmmakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_film).

Experimental filmmakers often work alone and must be competent as cinematographer, film lab, and editor to use an optical printer. One of the most famous experimental filmmakers was [Norm McLaren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_McLaren). He won an Oscar for his short [_Neighbours_](https://letterboxd.com/film/neighbours/) (1952), but his greatest work is arguably [_Pas de deux_](https://letterboxd.com/film/pas-de-deux/) (1968).

&lt;br/&gt;

The effects in _Pas de Deux_ can easily be recreated in almost any [Non-Linear Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_editing_system) now. Digital effects allow for a quicker creation, but it doesn't account for creative output. Working in a dark room with an optical printer, McLaren worked frame by frame, having to wait until the footage was processed at a [lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_laboratory) to confirm that it turned out as he expected.

While Hollywood largely transitioned away from Optical Printing by the end of the 1980's, experimental filmmakers continued to use these devices for their idiosyncratic works.

[The Heart of the World](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-heart-of-the-world/) (2000) is often taught in film schools as an introduction to experimental film. Guy Maddin claimed the film couldn't have turned out as expected [without an optical printer](https://guy-maddin.com/projects/the-heart-of-the-world/). Since then, Maddin has switched to mostly digital filmmaking, but the happy accidents that occurred in his earlier work can still be felt with every viewing, same as any other analog filmmaking.

There are so many more filmmakers that have utilized optical printing than what I've mentioned. Other notable filmmakers include to mention are [Stan Brakhage](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104132/), [Jonas Mekas](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0577263/), [Nobuhiko Obayashi](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643171/) (early work), [Pat O'Neill](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0642271/), and [Chick Strand](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833247/), though the list goes on and on with many fascinating works.
