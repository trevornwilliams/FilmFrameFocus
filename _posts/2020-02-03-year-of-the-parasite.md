With the US success of _[기생충](https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/)_ [[](https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/)_[Parasite](https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/)_[]](https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/), Neon has released Bong Joon-ho's [Black and White version](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bong-joon-ho-black-white-parasite-cut-1274862) in LA and NYC. This isn't the first time a filmmaker has revisited a film in black and white. _[Mad Max: Fury Road](https://letterboxd.com/film/mad-max-fury-road/)_ (2015) and _[The Mist](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-mist/)_ (2007) both had black and white versions released that were each considered the director's preferred cut. _Parasite_ in particular gives a greater level of contrast to the already layered story in the switch to black and white.

We see the world in color, but films must be [color graded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading) for us to accept them. Shot by shot, the color correctionist must confirm the look intended by the director and cinematographer. When accomplished photochemically, the process determines the length of exposure for each shot via [printer points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_point). The same process is mimicked digitally using a system such as [DaVinci Resolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve). When creating a black and white version of a film, the process is still corrected shot by shot so that every frame is exposed as intended since desaturating a shot can alter the perceived contrast.

[Kyung-pyo Hong](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393240/)'s cinematography and [Ha-jun Lee](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4342766/)'s production design complement one another perfectly in _Parasite_ in color, but by making it monochromatic, it brings greater attention to the [visual cues](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/parasite-cinematographer-hong-kyung-pyo-1202189824/#!) that separate them. Everything that needs to be seen is within [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_latitude), as the shadows show as much as the light. The families are contrasted that much more with the tonal variations in their setting and the light itself as the poorer family is always slightly darker than the richer family.

A few years ago, [Steven Soderbergh](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001752/) desatured [Raiders of the Lost Ark](https://letterboxd.com/film/raiders-of-the-lost-ark/) on his site [Extension 765](http://extension765.com/soderblogh/18-raiders) to study the staging. For me, the black and white brought greater attention to [Douglas Slocombe](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005878/)'s cinematography and perfect exposure. (The perfect exposure is even more impressive if [the stories of Slocombe](https://variety.com/2016/film/people-news/douglas-slocombe-dead-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-cinematographer-1201711843/#!) never using a [light meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_meter) are true.) The same works for _Parasite_, giving it a new dimension to admire its craft in what I believe was by far the greatest film of 2019.
