Film is an essential art in the communication of ideas to the masses. It allows for the acceptance and normalization of morals and the evolution of society. Any attempt at suppressing freedom of speech, whether through laws or by instilling fear, inhibits the arts and their impact on the world. As politics in the US experience a deepening rift between the American two party system, the freedom of expression is threatened out of fear of politicization of the most basic concepts. This is the greatest threat to the arts since the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) imprisoned ten men from Hollywood for the terrifyingly simple idea of being uncooperative in 1947.

Hollywood's pro-military stance during World War II had been re-interpreted as sympathetic to communism in the shift to peace time. With a change in the majority , films made with government support under a Democrat-led Congress were now seen as subversive under the new Republican-led Congress. With this shift in power from within the government, Hollywood was deemed a threat to the United States under the guidance of HUAC Chairman J. Parnell Thomas.

During the war, the Roosevelt administration had control over the Office of War Information (OWI). The OWI was responsible for controlling propaganda, making suggestions and attempting to influence the films released by Hollywood. They approved films such as _Action in the North Atlantic_ (1943) and _Mission to Moscow_ (1943) in an attempt to help with public perception of an ally, but it was for this very reason that the HUAC attacked it following the war. The growing fear of communism allowed Chairman Thomas to claim “hundreds of very prominent film capital people” were card-carrying communists and placed them on his long lists of names involved with the Communist Party. Though some people would become known as “friendly” witnesses for their cooperation, there were ultimately nineteen witnesses declared “unfriendly” by the committee.

Before going to Washington, the nineteen witnesses gathered at the house of Herbert Biberman to prepare for the testimony. All nineteen were at some point members of the Communist Party, but also ten of them were Jews. This does not seem to be a coincidence as the committee called upon cast and crew from two films released in 1947 that dealt with anti-Semitism: _Crossfire_ (1947) and _Gentleman’s Agreement_ (1947). The discussion at Biberman’s meeting was largely revolved around what the group of witnesses would say in front of the Committee, though no deep fear had been instilled in the nineteen yet.

In October of 1947, the hearings of the Hollywood witnesses began. People from all over Hollywood were being summoned to testify, conservative and liberal. The first witness called upon by the committee was then head of Warner Bros. Jack Warner. Alongside other “friendly” witnesses such as Louis B. Mayer, Warner consider himself and other cooperating witnesses to be blameless. Still, the committee cited them with producing anti-American referencing films such as _Mission to Moscow_. Warner would later claim in his ghost memoirs that Roosevelt personally asked him to produce _Mission to Moscow_, though he attributed it to Ambassador Joseph Davies during the hearings. Either way, calling these films anti-American was a largely political move as the Republican headed committee sought any defamation they could find against the Roosevelt administration.

After the attacks on the “friendly” witnesses, there came the time for the so-called “unfriendly” witnesses. Eleven of the nineteen “unfriendly” witnesses testified in front of the committee. They were mostly writers with all but one being Jewish. They were:

- Alvah Bessie
- Herbert Biberman
- Bertolt Brecht
- Lester Cole
- Edward Dmytrik
- Ring Lardner Jr.
- John Howard Lawson
- Albert Maltz
- Samuel Ornitz
- Adrian Scott
- Dalton Trumbo

The eleven “unfriendly” witnesses had all at one point or another been communists. Even if they were not still members, their left-leaning politics often showed up in their films. The idea of eliminating “intolerance and stereotypes” was an idea viewed by Chairman Thomas as communist and found to be a consistent theme from within all of their films.

Adrian Scott and Edward Dmytrik were brought in front of the committee because of their film _Crossfire_ (1947), which itself fought intolerance. The idea was that only a communist would make the murderer of a Jew to be a recently discharged soldier. _Crossfire_ was the first film to directly deal with anti-Semitism in the postwar years, coming at an appropriate time after the discovery of the atrocities of the Holocaust.

_Crossfire_ was praised commercially and critically before being nominated for five Academy Awards. Because it dealt with the trouble of reintegration into society by soldiers and prejudice built out of ignorance, the story was deemed subversive. Dmytrik explored the building tension inside and outside of the soldier accused in the film, most notably in the coffee scene. The soldier does not notice that the coffee is boiling over, using his distraction to comment on what happens in everyday life, but also it is at this time that he has a realization of the building situation around him. Showing an accused soldier’s weakness in contrast to a strong soldier as the actual murderer gave J. Parnell Thomas enough evidence to summon Dmytrik and Scott.

With _Action in the North Atlantic_, John Howard Lawson was able to express his support for the Communist Party indirectly. When an international convoy is set up to take supplies to Russia, we see equality among all of the nations involved. The ships sail as equals, representing the support of all of our allies in the war. One of Lawson’s main influences for the screenplay was _Battleship Potemkin_ (1925). He constructed it to be shot in a series of montages to keep the pace going and create a unified picture by clashing images together.

_Action in the North Atlantic_ was made for the Roosevelt administration at Warner Bros. under what was then nicknamed the Roosevelt Studio. Jack Warner was a devout follower of FDR. By attacking Action In The North Atlantic, Parnell had attacked Jack Warner and indirectly Roosevelt and the Democrat government during the war years.

Ten of the “unfriendly” witnesses cited the First Amendment as opposed to the Fifth Amendment and refused to cooperate. Only one agreed to cooperate with the committee. The other ten were then cited for contempt of Congress and quickly became known as “The Hollywood Ten.”

The attacks on the Hollywood Ten benefited Republicans as it spread the fear of communism while justifying their revenge on the former Democrat government. The final witness was separated from the rest by his lack of credits and foreign citizenship.

Bertolt Brecht only had one Hollywood screen credit to his name when brought before the committee. The film was _Hangmen Also Die!_ (1943). Directed by Fritz Lang, _Hangmen Also Die!_ was consistent to Brecht’s theatre work. The revolutionary attack of the workers coming together against fascism could easily reflect Brecht’s politics. The scenes of meetings of subversive members of the Czech resistance are separated from American ideology by endorsing the work of the group rather than the individual. The closest it comes to portraying individualism is the scene where Brian Donlevy tries to turn himself in for the greater good of the group. His fellow resistance fighter in fear that nobody else could do his job soon stops him. This was a film for every person to declare that the imposing government was bad.

Brecht understood what he was doing in front of the committee and the message he sought with his past work. _Hangmen Also Die!_ could not easily be brought against him because he only received a credit for story. He then cooperated fully in fear of being imprisoned under one of the Alien Registration Acts. Following his testimony to the committee, Brecht left the United States, being the last witness brought before the committee until 1951.

Following the DC hearings in October of 1947, the Hollywood studio system responded with the Waldorf Statement on November 25, 1947. The statement announced the studios would “forthwith discharge without compensation” and “not re-employ any of the Ten” until they had declared under oath they were no longer Communists. This began the Hollywood Blacklist.

With the Hollywood Ten, J. Parnell Thomas had destroyed the careers of a group of influential filmmakers. Some would come back to the industry following their prison sentences, such as Edward Dmytrik, and others, like Samuel Ornitz, would never work in the film industry again. Thomas sought to correct what he saw as a destruction of capitalism under Roosevelt and that he was “the great Voice of democracy" to fix the US. Instead, he exposed the vulnerability of democracy and the damage a demagogue can create in instilling the population with fear of something they deem different.
