# In with the Old

A [video was posted to YouTube](https://gizmodo.com/neural-networks-upscale-film-from-1896-to-4k-make-it-l-1841449875) today by [Denis Shiryaev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8J_xbbBuGobmw_N5ga3MA) showing how he used [Neural Network AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to [upscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_scaler) historic footage, in this case *[L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-arrival-of-a-train-at-la-ciotat/)* (1896). While similar AI techniques recently gained attention through [Deepfakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake), upscaling older footage has promising possibilities for film preservation—though it raises concerns about authenticity.

Personally, I love the idea of upscaling while still aiming for fidelity, but changing the framerate can resemble [motion smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation), often clashing with a filmmaker’s intent. It reminds me of the controversy in the 1980s when [Turner Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Entertainment) introduced [film colorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_colorization).

Would the [Lumière Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re) have opposed such manipulations of their film? Perhaps not—but that doesn’t mean we should do anything more than respectfully restore classic cinema. The documentary *[Lumière!](https://letterboxd.com/film/lumiere-2016/)* (2016) was a much more faithful approach, offering beautiful restorations. As for creative experimentation, it demonstrates that cinema can be changed in any way we can imagine.
