# Theatre on Film

With all their similarities, [theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre) and [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) are still different experiences. Theatre can be narrative based through [dramaturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy) or an experience such as [spectacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectacle) or [pageantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procession). Film can create endless worlds on screen, sometime narrative and sometimes avant-garde, that can allow for greater levels of detain in its quest for world building.

While prominent theatrical performances are often filmed and broadcast in cinemas, the planning is often less than cinematic. Performance is key to the theatrical experience, but the proper choice of [film stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_stock) in addition to the framing [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_\(visual_arts\)) allows for a more cinematic experience. [Ingmar Bergman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman)'s filmed version of _[The Magic Flute](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475331/)_ (1975) was important for this in trying to film the experience of a theatrical performance rather than the performance itself.

The primary difference between film and theatre is the [close-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up). The creative choice that makes _The Magic Flute_ watchable, aside from the brisk editing, is Bergman's choice to start behind the stage as he routinely goes in and out breaking that barrier, but also creating a deeper immersion for the performance on stage and capturing the audiences reaction through close-ups.

The audience is one of the most important parts of theatre. While film often strives for realism, there's an inherent suspension of disbelief that allows for more experimentation when the audience is present. [Tadeusz Kantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Kantor)'s _[The Dead Class](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176266/)_ (1977) is a classic of Polish avant-garde theatre captured on film by [Andrzej Wajda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Wajda).

_The Dead Class_ is, more or less, a work of memory and [nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism). Beyond that, it can be left to interpretation. What Wajda does in his film is cinematically capture what it can feel like for an intimate performance. This is not a stage, but there is an audience. The audience is less important compared to Kantor himself directing and orchestrating his play as Wajda directs and orchestrates the camera around it. As a different art-form than Bergman's opera on film, Wajda's experimental theatre replicates the intimacy of the avant-garde on stage.

Whereas _The Magic Flute_ was staged specifically for an audience to be filmed and _The Dead Class_ captured a performance as it would be seen in Poland at the time, [Louis Malle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Malle) stripped down the theatrical qualities to a minimum in _[Vanya 42nd Street](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111590/)_ (1994).

_Vanya on 42nd Street_ is an adaptation of [Chekhov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov)'s _[Uncle Vanya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Vanya)_, adapted by [David Mamet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet), staged by [Andre Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Gregory), and directed by Louis Malle. In setting the film up as a workshop rehearsal in an abandoned theater, the attention is brought to the fact that there aren't any costumes, sets, or audience. The [stage design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenic_design) is removed except for the few props they handle as part of the story.

Without the audience, we see the creative process of staging _Uncle Vanya_. Once we get used to the lack of stage design, we fall in love with the characters through the writing and camerawork specifically designed to let the performances shine. By placing _Vanya on 42nd Street_ inside a theatre, no matter how dilapidated, we become the necessary audience for _Uncle Vanya_.

The commonality in translating the theatrical experience for all three of these films is [Brecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht)'s [Verfremdungseffekt, or distancing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distancing_effect). For film to capture what it means to see live theatre, the artificiality of accepting a performance is on full display as these films break the [fourth wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall) and allow us to experience the performance above all else. To replicate the theatrical experience, there needs to be more [world building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding) by exposing the processes in staging rather than simply filming a performance.
