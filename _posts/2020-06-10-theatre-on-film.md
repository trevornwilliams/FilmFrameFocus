# Theatre on Film

Although [theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre) and [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) share many similarities, they’re distinct experiences. Theatre can be narrative-based or more experiential, such as [spectacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectacle) or [pageantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procession). Film can craft endless worlds with detailed sets or even venture into avant-garde territory.

Prominent stage shows are often filmed for cinema, though the result can be less than cinematic if not carefully planned. [Ingmar Bergman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman)’s *[The Magic Flute](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072848/reference)* (1975) is a landmark in filming an operatic performance in a way that feels alive on screen.

One crucial difference between stage and screen is the [close-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up). Bergman’s film moves between behind-the-scenes shots and tight close-ups, immersing us in the theatrical setting while letting us see details that a live audience would miss.

The audience’s presence is integral to theatre; in film, realism often dominates. Polish avant-garde master [Tadeusz Kantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Kantor) presented *[The Dead Class](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176266/)* (1977) as a performance recorded by [Andrzej Wajda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Wajda). Wajda’s camera captures the intimate atmosphere of Kantor’s memory-laden, nihilistic stage piece. Though not literally on a proscenium stage, it retains the feel of a live performance.

By contrast, [Louis Malle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Malle)’s *[Vanya on 42nd Street](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111590/reference)* (1994) strips away most theatrical elements. The adaptation, directed by Malle from [Andre Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Gregory)’s workshop, is set in a dilapidated theater with no audience and minimal props. The cast rehearses [Chekhov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov)’s *[Uncle Vanya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Vanya)*, and we become the only audience. That layered approach underscores how a stage play’s essence can be preserved through close, thoughtful cinematography, even without typical sets or costumes.

All three works use a form of [Brechtian distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distancing_effect) by revealing the artificiality of the stage. By “breaking the [fourth wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall)” (or at least exposing it) and showing us the process, these films replicate aspects of live theatre’s interplay between performer and spectator. Filming a theatrical performance often requires more world-building than simply pointing a camera at the stage.
